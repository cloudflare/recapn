//! An mpsc of requests and responses. This queue type is the core primitive behind
//! requests and responses in recapn-rpc. It supports many operations not found in
//! other primitives such as tokio mpsc and has many fewer allocations than building one
//! based on those primitives.
//!
//! A main benefit to this channel over a normal tokio mpsc channel is that channels of
//! this type can be forwarded to others at extremely low cost. This allows us to do
//! promise pipelining without needing to have forwarding tasks between queues. Instead
//! a pipelining queue can be made and then attached to the resolved queue when the
//! promise has resolved.
//!
//! Another benefit is that this channel doesn't need separate allocations for each step
//! in the request pipeline. Building off of tokio primitives would necessitate having
//! many allocations for sending requests and returning responses over one-shots, but
//! this set of types combines the channel queue with the oneshot mechanism and makes it
//! so one request makes one allocation.
