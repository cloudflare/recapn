# recapn

- [ ] Testing (by module)
  - [ ] message
  - [ ] io
    - [ ] stream
    * Fairly confident this already works. The code generator uses it and that works! But could use some tests either way.
    - [ ] packing
    * Desparately needs testing. I wrote it to prove the API would work and then moved on to RPC so I actually have no idea if it works. Should be easier to test than one based on some streaming API.
  - [ ] ptr
  * I've already implemented a few tests for this that check a lot of stuff in the library, but it probably needs more.
  - [ ] data
  * These can be implemented through doc tests
  - [ ] text
  * Same as data, can be implemented through doc tests
  - [ ] list
  * We need to test the different patterns that are expected to be usable by users of the library.

- [ ] Field accessors! Because someone 5 years ago thought it'd be a good idea to implement them in the library.
  - [ ] `PtrVariantOwner` generic accessors
  * Needs `by_ref`, `init_field`, `field`, `is_null`, `adopt`, `disown_into`, `try_clear`, and `clear` methods. We can basically just copy `PtrVariantBuilder` for this.
  - [ ] `PtrFieldBuilder` for `List<AnyStruct>`
  * Needs `try_set`, `set`, and `try_init`
  - [ ] `PtrFieldOwner` for `List<V>`
  * Copy from `PtrFieldBuilder`. Change lifetimes as appropriate.
  - [ ] `PtrVariantBuilder` for `List<V>`
  * Needs `get`, `try_set`, `set`, `init`, `try_init`, `init_with_size`. Essentially just the same accessors as `PtrFieldBuilder` but based on the variant helpers.
  * We also need the accessors from `List<AnyStruct>` which is slightly different due to the lack of fixed size to check.
  - [ ] `PtrVariantOwner` for `List<V>`
  * Copy from `PtrVariantBuilder`.
  - [ ] `PtrFieldOwner` and `PtrVariantOwner` for `Struct<S>`
  - [ ] `PtrVariantReader` and`PtrVariantBuilder` for `Text`
  - [ ] `PtrVariantReader` and `PtrVariantBuilder` for `Data`
  - [ ] `PtrVariantReader`, `PtrVariantBuilder`, and `PtrVariantOwner` for `AnyPtr`
  * Probably just needs an alias or two for the obvious ops.
  - [ ] `PtrFieldBuilder`, `PtrFieldOwner`, `PtrVariantReader`, `PtrVariantBuilder`, and `PtrVariantOwner` for `AnyStruct`
  - [ ] `PtrFieldBuilder`, `PtrFieldOwner`, `PtrVariantReader`, `PtrVariantBuilder`, and `PtrVariantOwner` for `AnyList`
  - [ ] `PtrFieldReader`, `PtrFieldBuilder`, `PtrVariantReader`, and `PtrVariantBuilder` for `Capability<C>`
  - [ ] Support "any" capability. We need some sort of marker for the type. Other than that it just returns whatever the `CapSystem`'s `Cap` type is.
- [ ] List accessors! Same thing as field accessors, but for list elements!
 - As a whole, list accessors need to be refactored to be more inline with field accessors in their current state. This brings with it better reusability of ptr element accessors like `is_null`, `clear`, `adopt`, and `disown_into`.
 - [ ] Owning list accessors. So you can pass an element back with ownership. Useful for struct lists and list lists.

# recapnc

- [ ] Generics
* These are a somewhat uncommonly used feature. An example of what this might look like in practice might be something like this:
```capnp
struct Map(Key, Value) {
  entries @0 :List(Entry);
  struct Entry {
    key @0 :Key;
    value @1 :Value;
  }
}
```

```rust
pub struct Map<Key = AnyPtr, Value = AnyPtr, T = Family> {
    key: PhantomData<fn() -> Key>,
    value: PhantomData<fn() -> Value>,
    inner: T,
}

pub mod map {
    pub struct Entry<Key = AnyPtr, Value = AnyPtr, T = Family> {
        key: PhantomData<fn() -> Key>,
        value: PhantomData<fn() -> Value>,
        inner: T,
    }
}
```

This will likely require refactoring to get the types right for field info.

- [ ] Interface support
* I'm not exactly sure what this will end up looking like. Not at least until RPC is closer to completion.

- [ ] Annotations
* I'm also not sure how this will look until schemas are implemented in recapn, which will likely happen after RPC.

# recapn-rpc

* [ ] Finish sync types
  * This library implements it's own synchronization primitives optimized for Cap'n Proto RPC. There are three modules:
    * `sharedshot`: a shared `oneshot` that doesn't require a separate allocation for the value
      * [ ] Just needs testing, the API is done.
    * `request`: a request value, a response `sharedshot`, and a pipeline map all wrapped up in a single allocation!
      * This only needs two more features implemented:
        * [ ] `Finished`: this type tracks when the request has no more response receivers listening to it.
        * [ ] Automatic removal from channel when finished. If a request is in an associated channel type, it will automatically
          remove itself from the channel, causing itself to get automatically canceled.
      * [ ] Also testing. Extensive testing.
    * `mpsc`: a specialized channel for handling `request` instances. Supports operations commonly used in Cap'n Proto RPC
      including channel forwarding where all items are forwarded to another channel as an O(1) operation. Future items get automatically
      forwarded when they're sent. Channels can also be closed with an error, causing all requests to be responded to with that
      same error.
      * [ ] `Sender::resolution` is an async function that awaits channel resolution.
  * These modules are designed to be generic for testing purposes. Outside of these modules, we only use one channel type.
* [ ] Client design
  * We need to implement the actual client types to make these sync types usable. This is mostly implementing wrappers that
    implement something similar to the C++ interface.
  * [x] You can make clients from futures of clients
  * [x] You can make clients from errors
  * [ ] You can await client resolution
  * [x] You can make new requests, build parameters, then send them
  * [x] You can await and read responses
  * [x] You can make pipelined clients
* [x] Server design
  * We need to design a flexible system for capnp `interface`s that can work with multiple different types of dispatchers.
    On one hand, many users would prefer to opt their servers into work-stealing multi-threading. But also, users might want
    to be more flexible and do async operations while reading parameters or writing responses. However, readers and builders
    have interior mutability, so they can't be used with work-stealing multi-threading. We don't know what kind of interface
    users want, so why not support both? Somehow... with generics!
  * [x] Work-stealing interface
    * For work-stealing we need to parse the parameters into some other type. Perform checks, do validation (sync), return
      data. This is then passed to another user provided function which does the work required. This can return a future
      which is then awaited. The result of this is then passed to another function which can do things like, make tail calls,
      write results, etc.
  * [x] Single-threaded interface
    * Work-stealing can't do everything Cap'n Proto has to offer. For the rest, we need an interface with a different set of
      trade-offs. In this one, request handling is done through a local set on a single thread. Of course, users can choose
      to spawn work on the work-stealing pool through tokio::spawn, but request handling must be done locally.
* [ ] Connections and RPC systems
  * I don't even know where to start with this, most of it isn't finished. Because it's so big and complicated I'm extremely
    tempted to break it up into smaller pieces that handle imports / exports and questions / answers.
